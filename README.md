# Hey there :raised_hands:

I code! Some Swift (leaning more on SwiftUI recently) but largely Python and
with a specific :heart: for Flask, SQLAlchemy and a smattering of plugins
provided by the wonderful Flask community. 

Currently I work for KH Capital&mdash; mostly internal facing web-applications 
(with a focus on systems supporting a physical grocery store chain operation)

"Full Stack" by necessity, usually leaning towards:

 - Ubunutu
 - Postgres
 - Nginx + Gunicorn
 - Flask
 - HTML5 + TailwindCSS + Alpine.js & jQuery

But I'm happy in the Windows ecosystem as well.
