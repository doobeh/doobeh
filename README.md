# Hey there :raised_hands:

I code! Some Swift & SwiftUI but largely Python and
with a specific :heart: for Flask, SQLAlchemy and a smattering of plugins
provided by the wonderful Flask community. 

Currently I work for KH Capital as the Group IT Manager&mdash; 
mostly with a focus on internal facing web-applications supporting 
the businesses under their umbrella across the Turks and Caicos
Islands.

"Full Stack" by necessity, usually leaning towards:

 - Ubunutu
 - Postgres
 - Nginx + Gunicorn
 - Flask
 - HTML5 + TailwindCSS + Alpine.js & jQuery
